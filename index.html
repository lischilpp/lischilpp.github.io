                <h3>Bachelor Thesis: Phoneme classification and alignment through recognition on TIMIT</h3>
                <p>
                    In this work, we explore a hybrid approach combining Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)
                    and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) for phoneme alignment on the TIMIT dataset.
                    The method leverages the output probabilities from a neural phoneme recognition model
                    alongside a probability-based DTW to achieve precise phoneme alignment.
                    For phoneme recognition, our model achieves an 18.1% Frame Error Rate (FER),
                    which represents a 4.0% improvement over the state-of-the-art.
                    Our alignment method attains an 86.3% phoneme boundary accuracy
                    within a 20ms tolerance.
                    To efficiently train the network we introduce the CyclicPlateauScheduler,
                    a learning rate scheduler that combines triangular cyclic learning rates
                    with ReduceLROnPlateau.
